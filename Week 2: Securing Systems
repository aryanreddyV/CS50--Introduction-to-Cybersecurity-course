#WEEK 2: Securing Systems
from harvard's CS50 : Introduction to cybersecurity course

#SUMMARY:
How to secure systems
Defenses
Techniques
Type of Malware and other attacks


#Concepts learnt:
 - HTTP: (Hypertext transfer protocol) -- This is a protocol/ a language that devices use to communicate in the WWW(World wide web) to exchange data over the internet

 - HTTPS: (Hypertext transfer protocol secure) -- This makes sure that data exchanges between two parties are encrypted and secure.

 - Machine in the middle attacks -- The machine in the middle is a type of attack where an attacker secretly inserts themselves into a communication channel between two parties who believe they are 
                                    communicating directly and privately. The adversary can then eavesdrop about your conversation or leak sensitive information/data and maybe even alter messages without
                                    either of the parties knowing.

 - Packet sniffing -- Packet sniffing is a process where an adversary intercepts the data packets as they travel across a computer network, basically eavesdropping the data packets as they travel across 
                      a network.

 - Cookies -- When you log in on any website nowadays, it shows you to allow or reject cookies. These cookies are basically used for the identification of the user from the system/device used.
              If you accept cookies, they are installed in your system in the memory. Everytime you log in to the same website, this cookies act like a verification ticket to prove that the person who 
              is logging in is actually the user.

 -Session hijacking -- If the internet page which you are on, is just HTTP, then it is not encrypted. In this case an adversary may be listening or can even know the data in the data packets which you 
                       interact with. To reduce this risk, we must check if the page is in HTTPS. If it is in HTTPS then it means that it is encrypted.

 -Digital certificate -- It is like a public key. This is digitally signed by someone else who is a third party

 -CA (Certificate Authority) -- They are the authorities for companies or organisations who shall digitally sign the certificates. The public key of the auhority and  signature as the inputs shall get 
                                the hash value. The hash value must match the authority's value because then only we can confirm that the certificate has been digitally signed by the Certificate Authority

 -SSL Stripping -- This is another type of attack where users think that they are secure connection and is encrypted but actually not. Worse yet, is that they might have secure connection with a 
                   third party such as Machine in the middle. So this third party may eavesdrop or even respond back to the user and may even trick the user redirecting on another unsecured website.
                   But just because there is HTTPS does not mean that it is secure. To take a step further The adversary may have bought a domain name very similar to the original and even have made it 
                   secured, so this is the sneaky part here.

 -HSTS (Hypertext strict transfer security) -- This is a type of security that secures the user by always redirectiong to HTTPS/ secured websites no matter what the user wants to do.
                                               If you visit the real secured website for the first time, then it will always make you visit only that website even if you tried to open that website. 
                                               By doing this, this minimizes the window of opportinities for the adversary. But you must not open an unsecured website for the first time.

 -VPN (Virtual private network) -- This is a powerful service that creates a secure and encrypted connection between the user and the remote server.

 -Port -- The data packets on the outside have mentioned port numbers. These port numbers have numbers which only should redirect to a specific website.

 -Port scanning -- Just like the brute force for the passwords, this is a method which tries all possible numbers for a server and then get access.

 -Penetration testing -- This is like a skill or a technique used for good purposes hopefully. They (people who have this job) which is to try finding possible weaknesses on an infrastructure and can 
                         even try removing or improving those weaknesses of your infrastructure before any adversary keeps an eye on you and they can be paid for their services.

 -Ethical hacking -- This is like a legal adversary who does this for good/legal reasons.

 -Firewall -- The name itself describes it a "wall" which keeps the data of the network inside to not going out and the outside data which prevents it from coming inside. It blocks the data traffic
              from outside to coming inside, and data inside to going outside. But it allows only the important port numbers which are needed for the infrastructure.

 -IP address -- This is like a mailing address for let's say every computer/internet device in the world. Every interent device has a unique IP address.

 -Deep packet inspection -- This is like a deep inspection of the data packets which do inspection of the IP address and domain names and even the contents inside the data packets to check if there 
                            are malwares or anything suspicious or malicious.

 -Proxies -- A proxy is very similar to a firewall. It sits between the inside and outside of the network and decides whether to send the data packets outside of the network. In this case, the 
             rejected data packets will be dropped or immediately deleted. The catch to this is that all the data traffic will be on this one point, and some prxies might not be real and secured.
             They may have been injected by an adversary to the software and then sending the traffic to somehwhere else. These bad proxies can even create their own CA's and thsu it will be
             dangerous.

 -URL rewriting -- It is a web server technique that internally changes the address a user requests in their browser to a different, underlying address that the web application understands, without
                   the user ever seeing the change in their address bar.

 -MALWARE -- This is one of the most threatening softwares. Malware is like a malicious software which tries to do malicious things to your system.
          1.Virus -- This type of malware attaches itself to the host. It enters to your system when the host opens an attachment that has been infected by the virus. 
          2.Worm -- This is another type of worrisome malware which can travel from one computer to another without any human interaction.
          3.Botnet -- A botnet is a network of internet-connected devices, each infected with specialized bot malware, that are remotely controlled by a single attacker.

 -DoS (Denial of Service attack) -- It is a cyber attack intended to make a network service or website unavailable to its legitimate, intended users.

 -Antivirus -- This is a software which should be installed in your computer or device to protect you from any viruses or worms and safely remove them. This software runs constantly in your system.
               But for the antivirus to know that if there are any viruses or worms, it needs Automatic updates. By doing Automatic updates atleast ensures you that you are not vulnerable to 
               problems of which exist.

 -Zero day attacks -- Now this is like if an adversary writes their own new malware and unleashes it to the network of computers, the antivirus may not have enough time to update and by then
                      our system might have been attacked.
