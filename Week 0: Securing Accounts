WEEK 0:Securing Accounts
from Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Cybersecurity course

SUMMARY: 
How to secure accounts and their passwords
Account security fundamentals
layered defenses
practical steps to protect and recover accounts

CONCEPTS LEARNT:
-Password Hygiene --- create long and unique passwords (upto 8 or more characters in preferable-including numbers of special letters and maybe even uppercase or lowercase letters) to prevent risk of getting 
                      attacked. Long passwords or even unique passwords will surely benefit by decreasing the risk of getting attacked and increasing the effort for the adversary to succesfully attack our 
                      account. Eventually the adversary may lose interest because of the time and effort needed to crack it.

-Brute force attck--- A brute force attack is a cybersecurity method where attackers systematically try every possible combination of usernames, passwords, or encryption keys to gain unauthorized access. 
                      These attacks rely on automation, using scripts to rapidly attempt a high volume of guesses until the correct combination is found. They are a simple but effective tactic, though 
                      complex passwords significantly increase the time needed for a successful attack. 
                       Some of the Defence mechanisms:
                     -Strong passwords-- the passwords shall be long and unique, so that it takes for time(maybe even years/decades/centuries if the password is very strong) and effort for a brute force 
                                        attack. Eventually the adversary most probably loses interest because of the time and effort needed if the password is strong.
                     -Multi factor Authentication-- Requires secondary form of verification in addition to a password. This minimizes the risk of the adversary to succesfully attack us.

-Password Managers --- Install and run password managers for maximum safety (they allow you to directly log in without using password, and also prevent you from fake websites and application). 
                       This reduces the risk for getting the passwords exposed. One and only con for this password manager is that, itself needs one and only password to store all the usernames with 
                       passowords.

-Multi factor Authentication --- This is a security method that requires to prove your identity by using two or more different types of evidences, not just a password. MFA adds an extra layer of defense and
                                 protection.Which means that even when your password is stolen, your account stays protected.
                                 There are 3 factor types in MFA which are-
                                 1. Knowledge: (something which you know)-example is "Password"
                                 2. Possesion: (something which you have)-example is "Phone"or "card"
                                 3. Inherence: (something which you are) -example is "Biometrics-like face, thumbprint, Iris recognition, voice recognition"

-Credential stuffing --- This is a type of method adversaries use to get access to our accounts. Say they get credentials of one of your accounts, he assumes the probability that you might have used the same 
                         credentials for other different websites. So he tries the credentials on all possible websites to gain access to all your other accounts too. To reduce the risk of this scenario 
                         happening, use different credentials for different websites or applications.

-Phishing attacks --- Phishing attacks trick users with fake emails and websites (always verify sender and links). They rely on deception and human error rater than using hacking systems directly. They are
                      a type of Social Engineering. They are fake sources which pretend to be real/trusted sources. Example- Email phishing--they are fake emails pretending to be real emails from officials 
                      or known source .They might send malware through links or attachments where have to provide our credentials, which is basically unknowingly installing malware into our system.

-Account Recovery --- It is a process of regaining access of an account if you forget your password, lose access to your device, or get locked out. It involves verification of your identity through backup 
                      option like recovery email, phone number, OTP(one-time password) or even security question.
