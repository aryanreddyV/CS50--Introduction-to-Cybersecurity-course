SUMMARY of learnt concepts:
Account security fundamentals, layered defenses, and practical steps to protect and recover accounts.

Skill concepts learnt:
-Password Hygiene --- create long and unique passwords (upto 8 or more characters in preferable-including numbers of special letters and maybe even uppercase or lowercase letters) to prevent risk of getting hacked.
-Password Managers --- Install and run password managers for maximum safety (they allow you to directly log in without using password, and also prevent you from fake websites and application).

-Phishing awareness --- Phishing attacks trick users with fake emails and websites (always verify sender and links).
-Account Recovery --- use seperate accounts for user/admin vs. daily use to reduce risk.
