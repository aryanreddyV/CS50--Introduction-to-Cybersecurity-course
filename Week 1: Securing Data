#WEEK 1: Securing Data
from Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Cybersecurity course

#SUMMARY:

#Concepts learnt:
-Hashing---An account's password is converted to hash( completely unidentical to the password written by the user) and stored in the website's database. It is hard for an adversary to perform an attack Credential 
           stuffing.It is stored(password converted to hash) in the website's database when the user creates an account for the first time. Next time the user tries to log in again with the same password, the 
           website converts the password to hash using the same process when the user created the account and then compares the hash to the stored hash in their database with the respective username. This reduces 
           the risk of adversaries to attack our account. Using this method raises the bar for protection and lowers the bar for risk, but its not guarenteed that the adversary cannot get acces to your account.
           This increases the work, energy and time for the adversary so that there are chances that he might lose interest in our account. This is irreversible process. The hash value cannot be reversible by 
           hashing.

-Encryption--- Encryption is a way of scrambling information so that onl authorized people can see it. The information or plaintext is converted into a cipher text with help of a key only authorized people have.
               The ciphertext can be decrypted by the authorized people who have the key.

-Rainbow tables--- It is basically like a large database with vast information.The information can be very large like terabytes or even petabytes.The information here disscussed are a lot of passwords with their 
                   hashes which the adversary might have already converted. Here to have a rainbow table, he must have a lot of hard-drives which contain the information and also a lot of wealth and effort
                   ( effort he must have done by converting the each possible passwords to their hashes).

-Salting--- It is a method where teh salt value is added to a password, and it creates a different hash value than the hash value of just the password. 
            So basically- salt value + password--> hash value is not equal to password--> hash value. So this Salt is a modifier the hash value when the salt input is added to the password input. 
            For example, say two usernames David and Daisy have same passwords. Here we can conclude that they will also have same hash values. So there is a risk that if one account gets hacked, the other one
            with the same password can also get hacked if the adversary wanted to. So to prevent this, Salt input shall be added to the password input. So say that David's salt input in 100 and Daisy's input 
            is 99, boht of their hash values will be completely different. The salt values are automatically given by the server itself. This ensures that even though David and Daisy have same passwords,
            there is no way that the adversary will know even if he was looking into it.

-Cryptography---The study of securing data
     -Coding -- This is referred to as an secret code, not an software program. This can be information of plaintext which is converted to something which makes absolutely no sense, but makes sense for the
                senders and the real receivers. The code can make no sense for if someone intercepted the code if they do not know how to crack the meaning of the code. 
                example: Enigma machine for Morse code which was used in the WORLD WAR II.
     -Encode -- This is the process where the information is converted to a code, which cannot mean the information directly, but it needs to be the information indirectly. Encoding means that converting 
                the information to a code.
                example: Using Morse code
     -Decoding -- This is a method to crack the meaning of the code. Which basically means reverse-code. Converting code information back to its original.
                  example: Barcode Scanners- When an item's barcode is scanned at a retail store, the scanner decodes the black and white lines into a numerical code. This code is then used by the 
                           store's system to identify the product, retrieve its price, and update inventory levels.

     -Cipher -- It is an algorithm which is used for converting an readable information to an unreadable information.
     -Encipher -- It is the process of converting plaintext to ciphertext.
                  example: The Enigma machine used in WORLD WAR II by Nazis could cipher
     -Decipher --The action of converting the scrambled ciphertext back into plaintext. 
                example: The Enigma machine could also decipher

     -Private/symmetric key cryptography -- The key is shared secret that only the sender and the receiver must have in advance. 
     -Public/Asymmetric key cryptography -- The key is shared with the public. The public will send you encryptions and only you will have the private key which will only you can decrypt their 
                                            encryptions.

-Digital Signatures --- Lets say we have a message (which is some informaation which you want to sign in it) as an input, you convert them to hash values. Now we take the computed hash value and a 
                        private key as inputs, the output will be known as the "Digital Signature".
